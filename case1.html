            <h4><b>Problem statement:</b></h4>
            <p class="flow-text">In every new academic year, students are being advised to use the student app in order to simplify their life at Solent university and take advantage of many facilities designated to help them succeed in their studies. However, a number of students get frustrated by the low performance, quality, and design of the app. Therefore, the majority of students eventually choose to use the web alternatives, such as SOL and Student Portal.
                <br><br>The number of students who use smartphones at Solent is significant and cannot be ignored. Thus, it is important to focus on this category of users and update the current app in the form of a mobile application that can be used by students on a daily basis throughout their studies at Solent university.
                <br><br>This should provide students with access to all the essential facilities and services to make their life at Solent university smooth and easy — All in one mobile application.</p>

            <p class="flow-text"><b>Business opportunities —</b></p>
            <p class="flow-text">At the same time, this will contribute in the promotion of Solent university courses, events, activities, experiences, and students engagement. — — And most importantly, this will open business opportunities for companies whose main target is the student by presenting their products, discounts, and offers that concern students on the app.</p>

            <h4><b>Research & Insight</b></h4>
            <p class="flow-text">Based on the analysis of students reviews on the two platforms iOS and Android , it seems the app has a number of issues in terms of the information architect, the usability, and the data response.
                <br><br>The analysis of students reviews helped not only to get accurate information from the main users, but also understand the problem they face while using the app throughout their studies at Solent university.
                <br><br>The reviews have shown students’ desire to enhance and elevate the usability of the app on the two platforms. And most importantly, students hope to make this app become a comprehensive alternative to all the websites provided by Solent university.</p>

          <h4><b>RESULTS</b></h4>
          <p class="flow-text">Many students who have tested the app expressed their positive feedback on the new information architect and user interface as a new usability experience to interact with the app sections.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">However, the aim is to integrate more services and enhance several sections of the app such as the map and the library with a view to facilitate the usage and give more convenient experience. This is expected to positively impact students’ experience throughout their studies at Solent University.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Another aspect is the top header, which some students suggest denominating it to promote university events, news, and offers that completely matches with the thoughts we have already stetted for this section in the site-mapping phase.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Moreover, students have expressed their desire to add a direct chatting experience with the classmate or tutors on the app in which they’ll be able to communicate and collaborate together without relying on an applications outside the Student app.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Overall, the usability has been improved compared with the old design, although some important improvements will be added to the app soon, particularly on the map section with more A.R experience.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Thus, the following questions have been attached with the new prototype in order to be answered by the students:</p>

        <article class="col s12 m12 offset-l2 l8">
          <h4><b>RESULTS</b></h4>
          <p class="flow-text">Many students who have tested the app expressed their positive feedback on the new information architect and user interface as a new usability experience to interact with the app sections.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">However, the aim is to integrate more services and enhance several sections of the app such as the map and the library with a view to facilitate the usage and give more convenient experience. This is expected to positively impact students’ experience throughout their studies at Solent University.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Another aspect is the top header, which some students suggest denominating it to promote university events, news, and offers that completely matches with the thoughts we have already stetted for this section in the site-mapping phase.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Moreover, students have expressed their desire to add a direct chatting experience with the classmate or tutors on the app in which they’ll be able to communicate and collaborate together without relying on an applications outside the Student app.</p>
          <p class="flow-text">Overall, the usability has been improved compared with the old design, although some important improvements will be added to the app soon, particularly on the map section with more A.R experience.</p>

          <h4><b>CONCLUSION</b></h4>
          <p class="flow-text">The usability testing helped to highlight so many important issues and think about alternative design solutions. The gathered notes and suggestions made the app more user-friendly, however further usability testing needs to be conducted in order to enhance the usability and integrate more services.</p>
